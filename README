oczupsh - ActiveSync for Owncloud

Based on
- z-push 2.0 beta's svn version
   http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/z-push/branches/z-push-2
- Owncloud's Head (should work on stable 3.0.1)
   git://gitorious.org/owncloud/owncloud.git

What works :
- Contact sync
- Tested with Android Emulator 2.3.3
- Reported to work on :
  - Samsung Galaxy S2
  - Iphone 4 and Ipad 2 (thanks a40a)

Todo :
- Fix VCARD format to V3.0
- Finish calendar/tasks
- mail/imap from owncloud's conf
- Owncloud integration :
  - app
  - configuration
  - device management (wipe, lock, etc...)
- Multi folder (multi calendar/addressbook)
- What else, tell me :)

Install:
- see INSTALL for install instruction
- update OC_DIR config var in config.php with owncloud directory

Upgrade z-push :
- z-push's .svn is integrated, svn up will work, but will probably prevent any git pull to work anymore
