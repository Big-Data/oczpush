oczupsh - ActiveSync for Owncloud

Based on
- z-push 2.0 beta's svn version
   http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/z-push/branches/z-push-2
- Owncloud's Head
   git://gitorious.org/owncloud/owncloud.git

What works :
- Contact sync
- Tested with Android Emulator 2.3.3

Todo :
- Fix VCARD format to V3.0
- Do calendar, Notes ?
- Owncloud config
- mail/imap from owncloud's conf
- Owncloud integration (apps/ or not?) ?
- Lot of things

Install :
- see INSTALL for install instruction
- update OC_DIR config var in config.php with owncloud directory

Upgrade z-push :
- z-push's .svn is integrated, svn up will work, but will probably prevent any git pull to work anymore
